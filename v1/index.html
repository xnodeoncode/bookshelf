    <!-- Suppress Google's FLoC warning
    https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/52356
    The "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'."
    warning is related to Google's FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) experiment, which is a part of their Privacy Sandbox initiative.
    This error is not critical and should not cause your page to fail to load. However, if you want to suppress this warning,
    you could try and set the Permissions-Policy header for your site: -->
    <meta http-equiv="Permissions-Policy" content="interest-cohort=()" />

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/site.css" />
    <title>App</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="container"></div>
    <!-- The main must be declared as a module via the type attribute.
    This ensures that the imports will work. -->
    <script type="module" src="./js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
